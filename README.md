## Concept

I've received the assignment to transfer data to my code editor and pursue to filter this data. I chose to use the external API called [ExchangeRate](https://rapidapi.com/exchangerateapi/api/exchangerate-api/). This API shows all the exchange rates of all currencies. Since my own currency is the Euro, I wanted to check all the values of different currencies that are equal to €1,-.

I've chosen to filter all the currencies and it's exchange rate into the continent it is a part of. This is done with the idea of making a visualisation about this in the future. The visualisation will show the amount of money you will have in each continent after exchanging €1,-.

## Process (Wiki)

You can find all the progression of my work documented in my [Wiki](https://github.com/dannyfrelink/Functional-programming/wiki).

## Wishlist

As I already told in [Concept](https://github.com/dannyfrelink/Functional-programming#Concept), I'm looking forward to making a visualisation around this API. It will give d information about which continent will make you the 'richest' by average. For the functional programming part, I would've liked to be able to try out a couple more filters. Since the API was pretty clean by itself and I wanted to use all the data, filtering was quite hard to do.

## Installing

If you're looking to use my code for yourself, you can clone this GitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/dannyfrelink/Functional-programming
```

You then move on to installing the packages I used on this repository:
```
npm install
```

Now you're ready to start the server with the following command:
```
npm start
```
